FoodTech is a mod for Minecraft, currently in very early development stages. It's a mix between me learning how to mod Minecraft and trying to make food in the game significantly more exciting.

The mod will use Universal Electricity for machines and may use the Mekanism API too. I am currently looking into mod compatibility and getting all this working.
